<h2 align="center">Welcome at my profile!</h2>

### About me
**Hey!** Umm, well, there's not much to say about me... I think...\
I'm a **Linux**-obsessed, **self-taught programmer** from **Germany**.\
Programming languages I'm familiar with are **C++, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python, PHP, Scratch - and maybe even more.**\
\
Btw I use Artix (:heart:) with i3-gaps, you can find my dots [here](https://github.com/xecortex/dots)

### What I like
- I love **(prog) Metal/Rock** bands like **Helloween, Dreamtheater or Foo Fighters**.
- I **travel** a lot, especially in countries with **mountains**, like **Austria**, **Swiss** and **Norway**, but also **Danmark**, the **Netherlands** and other countries
- **Gaming**. Minecraft, Apex Legends, Retro- and Indie-Games.
- I'm also interested in many sciences, especially astronomy, physics, mathematics and the questions about the meaning of life (you know thats the answer is 42, don't you?)

### What I do
Currently I am working on my [Spotify AdEleminator](https://github.com/xecortex/spotify-adeleminator) written in **Python**.\
Otherwise, I work on everything I feel like doing - like doing Linux stuff, coding games and webpages or maybe I build a House... I don't know what I do tomorrow!\
\
Oh, right, I forgot to say, I have [this](https://xecortex.ddnss.org) website where I do stuff. Boring stuff, mostly, but sometimes I also do cewl projects there.
